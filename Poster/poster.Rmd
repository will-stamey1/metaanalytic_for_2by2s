# Determining Stopping Rule Parameters

Type I and II errors of the procedure are adjusted depending on the stopping rule, an expression of sample size (number of samples drawn so far), sample variance, and four parameters, $h_1$, $h_2$, $d_1$ and $d_2$. The system of equations below expresses the relationship between Type I and II errors and these four parameters.

$$\begin{equation} \int_{h_1 \left( 1 - \frac{\psi_2}{d_1}\right)}^{\infty} \Phi^{K-1}\left(t + \frac{h_1(\psi_2 - \psi_1)}{d_1}\right)\Phi\left(\frac{h_2 d_1}{h_1 d_2}t - 2h_2 + 2\frac{h_2\psi_2}{d_2}\right)\phi(t)dt \\ = 1 - \beta \\ K\int_{h_1}^\infty \Phi^{K-1}(t)\Phi\left(\frac{h_2d_1}{h_1d_2}t - 2h_2\right)\phi(t)dt = \alpha \end{equation}$$

Where $K$ is the number of alternative treatments/populations, while $\psi_2$ is the effect size of substance above $\mu_0$, and $\psi_1$ is a marginal effect size above $\mu_0$, both specified by the researcher. 

Given $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$ are set by the researchers, the system has four unknowns. Solving it then requires setting two of the unknowns constant ($d_1$ and $d_2$) and then solving for the other two, $h_1$ and $h_2$, via a nonlinear optimization procedure. The R package NLEQSLV was used to accomplish this. The $d_1$ and $d_2$ values can theoretically be arbitrary positive numbers, but for a given set of researcher-chosen parameters, some values of $d_1$ and $d_2$ solve more easily than others.

# Procedure 

The sequential procedure takes place in two phases, each comprising a statistical test. In the first, a test determines whether one of the treatment sample means is significantly greater than the others. If the first test is rejected and it appears there is a greatest treatment, then in the second that population set apart is tested against $\mu_0 + \psi_2$. If the null hypothesis of the second test is rejected, then the treatment selected in the first phase is considered to be the greatest. Otherwise, no best treatment is selected. 

## Hypotheses: 

$$\begin{equation}
  H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = ... = \mu_K = \mu_0 \\
  H_a: \text{there is at least one acceptable population, and no } \\ \mu_i \text{ lies in the interval } (\mu_0 + \psi_1, \mu_0 + \psi_2)
\end{equation}$$

## Procedure Steps: 

### Phase 1: Isolate Best Procedure
 1. Sample $n_0 = max \{3, \lceil \frac{h_1}{d_1} \rceil \}$ from each of the K populations.
 2. Estimate $\sigma^2$ using $n_0$.
 3. Set $N = n_0$. While $N < \frac{h_1^2}{d_1^2}(s^2_{N} + 1/N)$, increase N by $n'$ samples (such that each population is sample $n'$ additional times). Once $N \geq \frac{h_1^2}{d_1^2}(s^2_{N} + 1/N)$, stop sampling. 
 4. Compute weighted average. If the greatest population sample mean, $\bar{X}_{KN} \geq \mu_0 + d_1$, then proceed to phase 2. Otherwise, end procedure and fail to reject null hypothesis. 

### Phase 2: Show Significant Improvement of Best Procedure
5. Sample $m_0 =  max \{3, \lceil \frac{h_2}{d_2} \rceil \}$ from the population selected in Phase 2. 
6. Estimate $\sigma^2$ using $m_0$, $s^2_{m_0}$. 
7. Set $M = m_0$. While $M < \frac{h_2^2}{d_2^2}(s^2_{M} + 1/M)$, increase $M$ by $m'$ samples. 
8. Once $M \geq \frac{h_2^2}{d_2^2}(s^2_{M} + 1/M)$, calculate weighted mean of the $M$ samples, $\bar{Y}_M$.
9. If $\frac{\bar{X}_{(KN)} + \bar{Y}_M}{2} \geq \mu0 + d2$ then reject $H_0$, and the treatment selected in phase one is the best. Else, fail to reject $H_0$ and select no best population. 

### Weighted Average of ith Treatment: 
$$\begin{equation}
  \bar{X}_N = \sum_{j=1}^Ma_jX_j \\
  a_{i1} = a_{i2} = \frac{c_1}{2}, a_{i3} = a_{i4} = ... = a_{iN} = \frac{1-c_1}{N-2} \\
  c_1 = 1 - \frac{N-2}{N}\left(1 + \sqrt{1 - \frac{N}{N-2} \left( 1 - \frac{2d_1^2}{s^2_Nh_1^2}\right)}\right)
\end{equation}$$
