# Introduction

What do we do with histories of analyses and experiments? Meta-analytic Priors (MAPs) are a powerful answer to this question, leveraging Bayesian statistical methods to incorporate past analyses into the design and strengthen the results of future experiments. 

2 x 2s with structural zeros are a kind of two-part binary test sequence where the result of the first test determines whether an individual is tested once more. Here, we apply a MAP to analyze the Risk Ratio in a new experiment which is of primary interest in 2 x 2s with structural zeros.

# 2 x 2s With a Structural Zero

A 2 x 2 with a structural zero is a sequence of two tests. For experiment $i$ on $n_i$ participants, the cumulative results of the tests are characterized by a trinomial distribution

\begin{equation}
    z_i \sim \text{trinomial}(n_i, \mathbf{p}_i)
    \label{eq:trinom}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{p}_i = \{\pi_{1i}, \pi_{12i}\}$. Since administration of the second test is dependent on the result of the first, 

# Bayesian Model 
$$
\begin{aligned} 
  y_{11}, y_{12}, y_{22} \; \sim \; &\text{Trinomial}(n, p_{11}, p_{12}, p_{22}) \\
  \\
  p_{1} = p_{11} &\; + \; p_{12}, \;\;\;  RR = \frac{p_{11}}{p_1^2}
  
\end{aligned}
$$


## (Hierarchical Model Plot)

$$ \theta_i = \{P_{1i}, RR_i\}$$

$$y_i \sim \text{Trinomial}(\theta_i)$$

$$ \text{ln}(RR_i) \; \sim \; N(\mu_{RR}, \sigma_{RR}) $$

$$ p_{1i} \sim \text{beta}(a, b) $$

$$ \mu_p = \frac{a}{a + b}, \;\; \rho_p = a + b$$

## Priors
$$
\begin{aligned}
  \mu_{RR} \; \sim \; N(0, 0.1), &\;\;\;\;\;\sigma_{RR} \sim \text{half}N(0, 1) \\ 
  \mu_p \sim \text{beta}(1, 1), &\;\;\;\;\; \rho_p \sim \text{Gamma}(0.1, 0.1)
\end{aligned}
$$
