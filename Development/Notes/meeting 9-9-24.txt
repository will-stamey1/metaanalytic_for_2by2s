- run simulations where each table has a different sample size, generated from a uniform distribution.

- rerun already done simulations but also track gelman rubin diagnostic
		- request two chains rather than 1 (look up how to do this in JAGS)
		- also add interval widths to table 3

- make a step-by-step application of the method
